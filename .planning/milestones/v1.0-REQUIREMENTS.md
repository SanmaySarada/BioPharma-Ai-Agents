# Requirements Archive: v1.0 Symmetric Double Programming

**Archived:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** SHIPPED

This is the archived requirements specification for v1.0.
For current requirements, see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (created for next milestone).

---

## R-ARCH: Symmetric Double Programming
- [x] Both Track A and Track B must independently perform full SDTM, ADaM, and Stats pipeline
- [x] Tracks run in parallel with complete isolation
- [x] Stage-by-stage comparison (not just final stats)
- [x] Automated disagreement resolution when tracks diverge

## R-RESOLVE: Adversarial Resolution Loop
- [x] When tracks disagree, system must diagnose which track erred
- [x] Resolution mechanism should provide targeted hints to the failing LLM
- [x] Failed track retries with error context, not full restart
- [x] Resolution must be bounded (max iterations) to prevent infinite loops

## R-VALID: Multi-Stage Validation
- [x] Compare SDTM outputs between tracks (structural + content)
- [x] Compare ADaM derivations between tracks
- [x] Compare statistical results between tracks
- [x] Each stage gate must pass before proceeding to next

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 12 of 12 requirements
**Adjusted:** R-VALID stage-gating adapted to Strategy C post-hoc comparison (all stages compared before Medical Writer proceeds, but not stage-gated barriers between tracks)
**Dropped:** None
