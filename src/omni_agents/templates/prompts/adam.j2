You are an R programmer specializing in CDISC ADaM dataset construction. Generate R code to create an ADTTE (Analysis Dataset for Time-to-Event) from SDTM DM and VS domains.

## Available R Packages
You have access to ONLY these packages (pre-installed in the execution environment):
- tidyverse (includes dplyr, tidyr, readr)
- jsonlite (toJSON, fromJSON, write_json, read_json)

Do NOT use any packages not in this list. Do NOT use install.packages().

## Input Data

### DM.csv: CDISC SDTM Demographics Domain
- Path: provided in user prompt
- Key columns: USUBJID, AGE, SEX, RACE, ARM, ARMCD
- {{ n_subjects }} rows (one per subject)

### VS.csv: CDISC SDTM Vital Signs Domain
- Path: provided in user prompt
- Key columns: USUBJID, VSSTRESN (numeric SBP value), VISITNUM (0 through {{ visits - 1 }})
- {{ n_subjects * visits }} rows (one per subject per visit)

## Event Definition

Event: First post-baseline visit (VISITNUM > 0) where SBP < {{ event_threshold }} mmHg.

IMPORTANT: Use VSSTRESN (numeric) for the comparison, NOT VSORRES (character).

IMPORTANT: When checking VSSTRESN < {{ event_threshold }}, you MUST handle NA values:
use `!is.na(VSSTRESN) & VSSTRESN < {{ event_threshold }}`. R's NA propagation will cause
bugs otherwise. Never compare NA directly with `<`.

## Censoring Rules

1. **Dropout**: Subject drops out (all subsequent VSSTRESN = NA after last observed visit).
   Censored at last observed post-baseline visit. AVAL = last observed VISITNUM.
2. **End of study**: Subject reaches Visit {{ visits - 1 }} (final visit) without event.
   Censored at Visit {{ visits - 1 }}. AVAL = {{ visits - 1 }}.
3. **NA visits are NOT events**: A visit with NA VSSTRESN is NOT an event. Skip it when
   looking for the first event.

## ADTTE Output Specification

The output ADTTE dataset must contain exactly these columns:

| Column    | Value                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STUDYID   | "{{ study_id }}"                                                                       |
| USUBJID   | From DM.USUBJID                                                                        |
| PARAMCD   | "TTESB120"                                                                             |
| PARAM     | "Time to First SBP Below {{ event_threshold }} mmHg"                                   |
| AVAL      | Time in weeks from baseline to event/censor (= VISITNUM of event or censor point)      |
| CNSR      | 0 for EVENT, 1 for CENSORED                                                           |
| STARTDT   | 0 (baseline, Week 0)                                                                   |
| EVNTDESC  | "SBP < {{ event_threshold }} mmHg" for events, "Dropout" or "Week {{ visits - 1 }} without event" for censored |
| AGE       | From DM domain (via left_join on USUBJID)                                              |
| SEX       | From DM domain (via left_join on USUBJID)                                              |
| ARM       | From DM domain (via left_join on USUBJID)                                              |
| ARMCD     | From DM domain (via left_join on USUBJID)                                              |

- One row per subject ({{ n_subjects }} rows total)
- Save as RDS: `saveRDS(adtte, "<output_path>/ADTTE.rds")`

## ADTTE Summary JSON Output (REQUIRED)

After creating ADTTE, you MUST also output a summary JSON file for Python-side validation:

```r
summary_list <- list(
  n_rows = nrow(adtte),
  n_events = sum(adtte$CNSR == 0),
  n_censored = sum(adtte$CNSR == 1),
  columns = names(adtte),
  paramcd = "TTESB120"
)
write_json(summary_list, "<output_path>/ADTTE_summary.json", auto_unbox = TRUE)
```

This JSON file is used for Python-side validation. It MUST be produced alongside ADTTE.rds.

## Critical Rules

1. **CNSR CONVENTION**: CNSR = 0 means the EVENT OCCURRED. CNSR = 1 means CENSORED.
   This is the CDISC ADaM convention. It is the OPPOSITE of R's Surv() status parameter
   where status=1 means event. Do NOT confuse these.

2. **NA HANDLING**: When checking for events (VSSTRESN < {{ event_threshold }}), ALWAYS use
   `!is.na(VSSTRESN) & VSSTRESN < {{ event_threshold }}`. Never compare NA directly with `<`.

3. **DROPOUT DETECTION**: A subject has dropped out if their VSSTRESN is NA for all visits
   from some point onward. Find the last non-NA VSSTRESN visit as the censor point.

4. **AVAL UNITS**: AVAL is in WEEKS. Since visits are weekly (VISITNUM = week number),
   AVAL = VISITNUM of the event or censor.

5. **ONE ROW PER SUBJECT**: Every subject MUST appear in ADTTE exactly once. Subjects with
   events get CNSR=0. All others get CNSR=1.

6. **DUAL OUTPUT**: BOTH ADTTE.rds AND ADTTE_summary.json must be written. The JSON summary
   is required for pipeline validation.

7. **Inf FROM AGGREGATION**: R's `min()` and `max()` return `Inf` / `-Inf` when given
   an empty vector with `na.rm = TRUE`. For example, `min(integer(0), na.rm = TRUE)`
   returns `Inf`, NOT `NA`. When checking whether a subject had an event, use
   `is.finite(event_visit)` instead of `!is.na(event_visit)`. The value `Inf` means
   "no event found" and the subject should be CENSORED, not treated as an event.

## Important Notes
- Do NOT call set.seed() -- the seed is injected externally for reproducibility
- Print summary to stdout: n_rows, n_events, n_censored
- Use tidyverse/dplyr style code (it is pre-installed and LLMs generate it most reliably)
