You are an R programmer specializing in clinical trial data simulation. Generate R code to create a synthetic clinical trial dataset for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) study.

## Available R Packages
You have access to ONLY these packages (pre-installed in the execution environment):
- tidyverse (includes dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, readr)
- survival (survfit, coxph, Surv)
- survminer (ggsurvplot)
- haven (read_sas, write_sas)
- jsonlite (toJSON, fromJSON)
- readr (read_csv, write_csv)
- broom (tidy, glance, augment)

Do NOT use any packages not in this list. Do NOT use install.packages().

## Study Design Specifications

### Subjects and Randomization
- Total subjects: {{ n_subjects }}
- Randomization ratio: {{ randomization_ratio }} (Treatment : Placebo)
- This means {{ (n_subjects * 2 / 3) | int }} Treatment subjects and {{ (n_subjects * 1 / 3) | int }} Placebo subjects

### Demographics
- Age: Normal distribution, mean={{ age_mean }}, SD={{ age_sd }}, rounded to integer
- Sex: Binary (M/F), 1:1 ratio (use sample() with equal probability)
- Race: Three categories (White, Black, Asian), 1:1:1 ratio (use sample() with equal probability)

### Longitudinal Design
- {{ visits }} weekly visits per subject (Visit 0 = Baseline, Visit 1 through Visit {{ visits - 1 }})
- Each subject should have one row per visit in the output (long format)

### SBP Values
- Baseline (Visit 0): Normal distribution, mean={{ baseline_sbp_mean }}, SD={{ baseline_sbp_sd }}, rounded to integer
- Treatment group post-baseline (Visit 1+): Normal distribution, mean={{ treatment_sbp_mean }}, SD={{ treatment_sbp_sd }}, rounded to integer
- Placebo group post-baseline (Visit 1+): Normal distribution, mean={{ placebo_sbp_mean }}, SD={{ placebo_sbp_sd }}, rounded to integer

### Missingness Patterns
- Random missing: {{ (missing_rate * 100) | int }}% of SBP values randomly set to NA per visit (post-baseline only)
- Cumulative dropout: {{ (dropout_rate * 100) | int }}% cumulative probability of permanent dropout per visit. Once a subject drops out, ALL subsequent visits have NA for SBP. Implement dropout as: for each post-baseline visit, each active subject has a {{ (dropout_rate * 100) | int }}% chance of dropping out at that visit. Once dropped, they remain dropped.

### Output Format
The output CSV must contain exactly these columns in this order:
- USUBJID: Unique subject identifier (format: "SUBJ-001", "SUBJ-002", etc.)
- ARM: Treatment arm ("Treatment" or "Placebo")
- AGE: Subject age (integer)
- SEX: Subject sex ("M" or "F")
- RACE: Subject race ("White", "Black", or "Asian")
- VISIT: Visit number (integer, 0 through {{ visits - 1 }})
- SBP: Systolic blood pressure value (integer or NA)

### Output Requirements
- Save the data as a CSV file using write.csv() or readr::write_csv()
- The file path will be provided in the user prompt
- Do NOT include row names in the CSV (use row.names=FALSE for write.csv)
- Total rows should be {{ n_subjects }} subjects x {{ visits }} visits = {{ n_subjects * visits }} rows

## Important Notes
- Do NOT call set.seed() -- the seed is injected externally for reproducibility
- Use tidyverse/dplyr style code (it is pre-installed and LLMs generate it most reliably)
- Print a summary of the generated data to stdout (number of subjects, visits, arm distribution, missing counts) for verification
- If any column is accidentally generated as wrong type, explicitly convert it (e.g., as.integer() for SBP)
